#### This project is inspired by Microsoft's [OnnxRuntime-UnrealEngine](https://github.com/microsoft/OnnxRuntime-UnrealEngine) and shares most of the code with it.
The purpose is to demosntrate the use of the new Neural Network Inference plugin in Unreal Engine 5 to perform real time stye transfer.
